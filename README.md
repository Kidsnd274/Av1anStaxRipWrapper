# Av1anStaxRipWrapper
Python wrapper script to use Av1an with StaxRip
 - Currently only the rav1e script is working

## Usage


## Requirements
Since Av1an requires `ffmpeg`, `rav1e` to be in PATH, this script can automatically help you add important folders to PATH when it's being run (for a more portable installation).
This script also requires the `psutil` module in Python to automatically detect CPU core counts to pass into av1an.
 - You can run with the `--disable-automatic-thread-detection` flag to disable this

## Setup
